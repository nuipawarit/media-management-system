## Database Schema

```
{
  author: string;
  extension: "jpg" | "jpeg" | "png" | "mp4";
  id: string;
  name: string;
  size: number;
  thumbnail: string;
  uploadTime: number;

## Browser Support

Because this project uses CSS3 features, itâ€™s only meant for modern browsers. Some browsers currently fail to apply some of the styles correctly.

Chrome and Firefox have full support, but Safari and IE have strange behaviors.
